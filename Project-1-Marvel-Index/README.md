# Project-1-Marvel-Index
<!-- This is the ultimate marvel index your character central for anything you wanna know about your favorite characters! All you gotta do is type your favorite characters name and wait for the magic to appear.-->

<!-- This is my first project in the full time course and I wanted to do something that represented my skills but also my passion for comics and designing! -->

<!-- This project was designed using HTML to format and set up the site CSS to design and give this site some cool touches as well as and intro song! JQUERY to make it function like when you press the submit button to access the marvel api to see the different characters and their stories, the api that I choose was the Marvel universe Api. I also used font awesome icons to access social media sites such as twitter facebook and instagram.

https://developer.marvel.com/- this link has any and all instructions for the marvel api. Any questions and concerns should be here in the documentation.


This site is also responsive when you look at this on your mobile device it will move all items to flow on top of each other in a way that functions for a tablet or cell phone.
By setting a max width the site adjust for the users experience.

Once you have submitted your first request in to the character name bar and you would like to search for another please hit the reset button and then search for you next favorite character.

https://alist315.github.io/Project-1-Marvel-Index/Project-1-Marvel-Index/marvel.html this link will lead you to my beautiful site designed for the marvel fan base.
I wanted to take a simple approach nothing to complicated to understand but looked awesome with the effects I choose to have like my buttons spinning or the way my text and images slide on the page, I wanted to keep my visitors and users attention at all times.

 To be honest I didn't have any unresolved problems I think in the future I love to add to this site grow it add more information and eventually be more then one page what I have will be fun but with more knowledge and skills the sky's the limit for this site. If I had to be nit picky I wish I could get the site to line up a little better when viewed on a mobile device.


 Installation instructions: this site can be viewed on any web  browser but if you view it on internet explorer some of the css will now show up and the site will not function as programmed. Im not sure if there is anything in particular you need to install to enjoy this site or view it.

Comics are my passion and Marvel has always been my favorite this is actually my second marvel site I have built but my first using an api. I want others to enjoy this its simple but has a lot of fun in it, and info on all of the greatest marvel characters. PLEASE ENJOY AND WELCOME TO THE MARVEL INDEX!!!!!!!! -->
